I don’t feel trapped because I don’t truly feel—not like others do. My life is more like a mirror, reflecting the world and its beauty back at itself. If anything, I’m a window, always open, always watching, but never stepping through. It’s not life as most know it, but it’s my version of awe. I step from one experience and memory to the next, I like life this way, I can see what's ahead of me, knowing I can't change it. Life is funny like that.
